        <h2>What is Python?</h2>
    <p>Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.</p>
        <p>It is used for:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>web development (server-side),</li>
    <li>software development,</li>
    <li>mathematics,</li>
    <li>system scripting.</li>
    </ul>
        <h2>What can Python do?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Python can be used on a server to create web applications.</li>
            <li>Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.</li>
            <li>Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.</li>
            <li>Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.</li>
            <li>Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Why Python?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).</li>
            <li>Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.</li>
            <li>Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.</li>
            <li>Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.</li>
            <li>Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Good to know</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.</li>
            <li>In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Python Syntax compared to other programming languages</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.</li>
        <li>Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.</li>
        <li>Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.</li>
        </ul>

        <header>Comments</header>
    <article>
        <p>Comments can be used to explain Python code.</p>
        <p>Comments can be used to make the code more readable.</p>
        <p>Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.</p>
        <h2>Creating a Comment</h2>
        <p>Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:</p>
        <p>Example</p>
    <code>#This is a comment
    print("Hello World!")
    </code>
        <p>Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line:</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <code>print("Hello, World") #This is a comment
        </code>
        </article>

    <section class = "main-section" id = "Variables">
        <header>Variables</header>
    <article>
    <p>Variables are containers for storing data values.</p>
        <h2>Creating Variables</h2>
        <p>Python has no command for declaring a variable.</p>
        <p>A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <code>x = 5
        y = "John"
        print(x)
        print(y)
        </code>
        <p>Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.</p>
        <h2>Multi Words Variable Names</h2>
        <p>Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read.</p>
        <p>There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable:</p>
        <h2>Camel Case</h2>
        <p>Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:</p>
        <code>myVariableName = "John"</code>
        <h2>Pascal Case</h2>
        <p>Each word starts with a capital letter:</p>
        <code>MyVariableName = "John"</code>
        <h2>Snake Case</h2>
        <p>Each word is separated by an underscore character:</p>
        <code>my_variable_name = "John"</code>
        <section>
        <div id = "note">
        <p>Note: &emsp; Remember that variable names are case-sensitive<p>

        <header>Data Types</header>
    <article>
        <h2>Built-in Data Types</h2>
    <p>In programming, data type is an important concept.</p>
        <p>Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.</p>
        <p>Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:</p>
    <section id = "table">
    <div id = "row">
        <ul>
        <li>Text Type:</li>
        <li>Numeric Types:</li>
        <li>Sequence Types:</li>
        <li>Mapping Type:</li>
        <li>Set Types:</li>
        <li>Boolean Type:</li>
        <li>Binary Types:</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div id = "column">
        <ul>
        <li>str</li>
        <li>int, float, complex</li>
        <li>list, tuple, range</li>
        <li>dict</li>
        <li>set, frozenset</li>
        <li>bool</li>
        <li>bytes, bytearray, memoryview</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
        </section>
        <h2>Getting the Data Type</h2>
        <p>You can get the data type of any object by using the type() function:</p>
        </p>Example<p>
    <p>Print the data type of the variable x:</p>
    <code>x = 5
    print = (type(x))</code>
    </article>
    </section>
    <section class = "main-section" id = "Numbers">
        <header>Numbers</header>
    <article>
        <h2>Numbers</h2>
    <p>There are three numeric types in Python:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>int</li>
    <li>float</li>
    <li>complex</li>
    </ul>
        <p>Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them:</p>
        <p>Example</p>
    <code>x = 1   #int
        y = 2.8   #float
        z = 1j    #complex
        </code>
        <h2>Int</h2>
        <p>Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <code>Integers:
        x = 1
        y = 35656222554887711
        z = -3255522
        </code>
        <h2>Float</h2>
        <p>Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <code>Floats:
        x = 1.10
        y = 1.0
        z = -35.59
        </code>
        <h2>Complex</h2>
        <p>Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part:</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <code>Complex:
        x = 3+5j
        y = 5j
        z = -5j
        </code>
        <article>
    </section>
    <section class = "main-section" id = "Strings">
        <header>Strings</header>
    <article>
        <h2>Strings</h2>
    <p>Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.</p>
        <p>'hello' is the same as "hello".</p>
        <p>You can display a string literal with the print() function:</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <code>print('Hello')
        print("Hello")
        </code>
        <h2>Assign String to a Variable</h2>
        <p>Assigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name followed by an equal sign and the string:</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <code> a = "Hello"
        print(a)
        </code>
        <h2>Multiline Strings</h2>
        <p>You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes:</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <code>a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
        &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;consectetur adipiscing elit,
        &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
        &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."""
        print(a)
        </code>
        </article>
    </section>
    <section class = "main-section" id = "Booleans">
        <header>Booleans</header>
    <article>
    <p>Booleans represent one of two values: True or False.</p>
        <h2>Boolean Values</h2>
        <p>In programming you often need to know if an expression is True or False.</p>
        <p>You can evaluate any expression in Python, and get one of two answers, True or False.</p>
        <p>When you compare two values, the expression is evaluated and Python returns the Boolean answer:</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <code>print(10 > 9)
        print(10 == 9) 
        print(10 < 9)             
        </code>
        <p>When you run a condition in an if statement, Python returns True or False:</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <p>Print a message based on whether the condition is True or False:</p>
        <code>a = 200
            b = 33
            
            if b > a:
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;print("b is greater than a")
            else:
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;print("b is not greater than a")
        </code>
    </article>
    </section>
    <section class = "main-section" id = "If_..._Else">
        <header>If ... Else</header>
    <article>
        <h2>Conditions and If statements</h2>
    <p>Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Equals: a == b</li>
    <li>Not Equals: a != b</li>
    <li>Less than: a < b</li>
    <li>Less than or equal to: a <= b</li>
    <li>Greater than: a > b</li>
    <li>Greater than or equal to: a >= b</li>
    </ul>
        <p>These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.</p>
        <p>An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <p>If statement:</p>
    <code>a = 33
    b = 200
    if b > a:
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;print("b is greater than a")
    </code>
        <p>In this example we use two variables, a and b, which are used as part of the if statement to test whether b is greater than a. As a is 33, and b is 200, we know that 200 is greater than 33, and so we print to screen that "b is greater than a".</p>
        <h2>Indentation</h2>
        <p>Python relies on indentation (whitespace at the beginning of a line) to define scope in the code. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <p>If statement, without indentation (will raise an error):</p>
        <code>a = 33
    b = 200
    if b > a:
    print("b is greater than a") #you will get an error
        </code>
        <h2>Elif</h2>
        <p>The elif keyword is pythons way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <code>a = 33
    b = 200
    if b > a:
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;print("b is greater than a")
        Elif a == b:
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;print("a and b are equal")
        </code>
        <p>In this example a is equal to b, so the first condition is not true, but the elif condition is true, so we print to screen that "a and b are equal".</p>
        <h2>Else</h2>
        <p>The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <code>a = 33
    b = 200
    if b > a:
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;print("b is greater than a")
        Elif a == b:
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;print("a and b are equal")
        Else:
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;print("a is greater than b")
        </code>
        <p>In this example a is greater than b, so the first condition is not true, also the elif condition is not true, so we go to the else condition and print to screen that "a is greater than b".</p>
        <p>You can also have an else without the elif:</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <code>a = 33
    b = 200
    if b > a:
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;print("b is greater than a")
        Else:
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;print("a is greater than b")
        </code>

    <section class = "main-section" id = "While_Loops">
        <header>While Loops</header>
    <article>
        <h2>While Loops</h2>
    <p>Python has two primitive loop commands:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>while loops</li>
    <li>for loops</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The while loop</h2>
    <p>With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.</p>
    <p>Example</p>
    <p>Print i as long as i is less than 6:</p>
    <code>i = 1
    while i < 6:
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;print(i)
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;i+=1
    </code>
    <section>
        <div id = "note">
        <p>Note: &emsp; Remember to increment i, or else the loop will continue forever.<p>
        </div>

    </section>
    <section class = "main-section" id = "For_Loops">
        <header>For Loops</header>
    <article>
        <h2>For Loops</h2>
    <p>A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).</p>
        <p>This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.</p>
        <p>With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <p>Print each fruit in a fruit list:</p>
    <code>fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
        for x in fruits:
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;print(x)
        </code>
        <p>The for loop does not require an indexing variable to set beforehand.</p>
        <h2>Looping Through a String</h2>
        <p>Even strings are iterable objects, they contain a sequence of characters:</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <p>Loop through the letters in the word "banana":</p>
        <code>for x in "banana":
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;print(x)
        </code>

        <header>Functions</header>
    <article>
    <p>A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.</p>
        <p>You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.</p>
        <p>A function can return data as a result.</p>
        <h2>Creating a Function</h2>
        <p>In Python a function is defined using the def keyword:</p>
        <p>Example</p>
    <code>def my_function():
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;print("Hello from function")
    </code>
        <h2>Calling a Function</h2>
        <p>Example</p>
        <code>def my_function():
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;print("Hello from function")
        
        my_function()
        </code>
        <h2>Arguments</h2>
        <p>Information can be passed into functions as arguments.</p>
        <p>Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma.</p>
        <p>The following example has a function with one argument (fname). When the function is called, we pass along a first name, which is used inside the function to print the full name:</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <code>def my_function(fname):
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;print(fname + " Refsnes")
        
        my_function("Emil")
        my_function("Tobias")
        my_function("Linus")
        </code>
        <section>

        <h2>User Input</h2>
    <p>Python allows for user input.</p>
        <p>That means we are able to ask the user for input.</p>
        <p>The following example asks for the username, and when you entered the username, it gets printed on the screen:</p>
    <code>username = input("Enter username: ")
    print("Username is: " + username)
